    "## The Discovery of Sirius B\n",
    "In 1838, [Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel) used the technique of stellar parallax to find the distance to the star 61 Cygni.  The next candidate Bessel tried was [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius), the brightest star in the sky.  It's parallax angle is $p = 0.379^{\\prime\\prime}$, which corresponds to a distance of only 2.64 pc, or 8.61 ly. Sirius' brilliance is due (in part) to its proximity to Earth.  Bessel tracked Sirius' path across the sky and found that it deviated slightly from a straight line.  Using 10 years of precise observation, Bessel concluded (in 1844) that Sirius was actually a binary star system.  He deduced that the binary orbital period was 50 years, where the modern value is $50.1284 \\pm 0.0043$ years ([Bond et al 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6af8)) and the position of the secondary star.\n",

    "Bessel's telescopes were incapable of finding the \"Pup\" (i.e., the unseen companion of the luminous \"Dog Star\") due to the glare of Sirius.  After Bessel's death in 1846, the search for the Pup waned.  In 1862, [Alvan Graham Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvan_Graham_Clark) tested his father's new 18-inch refractor (3 inches longer than any previous instrument) on Sirius, and he discovered the Pup at its predicted position.  The dominant Sirius A was measured to be nearly $1000\\times$ brighter than the Pup (now called Sirius B).  The orbits of the stars about their center of mass revealed that Sirius A and Sirius B are about $2.3\\ M_\\odot$ and $1.0\\ M_\\odot$, respectively.  The modern values are $2.063 \\pm 0.023\\ M_\\odot$ and $1.018 \\pm 0.011\\ M_\\odot$ ([Bond et al 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6af8)).\n",

The great difference in their luminosities: $L_A = 25.4\\ L_\\odot$ and $L_B=0.056\\ L_\\odot$ makes observations difficult when the stars are closer together on the sky.  The next apastron comes 50 years later, where spectroscopists developed the tools to measure each star's surface temperature.  From the Pup's faint appearance, astronomers expected it to be cool and red, but they discovered that it is a hot, blue-white star that emits much of its energy in the UV.  Modern observations measure the surface temperature of Sirius B (the Pup) at $25,000 \\pm 200\\ {\\rm K}$, which is much hotter than Sirius A at $9940\\ {\\rm K}$.\n",

Alternatively, a single white dwarf may be transformed between the DA and non-DA spectral types through convective mixing.  For example, the helium convection zone's penetration into a thin hydrogen layer could change a DA into a DB white dwarf by diluting the hydrogen with additional helium. \n",

    "White dwarfs with surface temperatures of $T_e \\approx 12,000\\ {\\rm K}$ lie within the instability strip of the H-R diagram and pulsate with periods between $100-1000\\ {\\rm s}$.  In 1968, Arlo Landolt discovered a class of variable white dwarf stars, which are known as **ZZ Ceti** variables or **DAV** stars.  The pulsation periods correspond to the nonradial *g*-modes that resonate within the white dwarf's surface layers of hydrogen and helium.  These *g*-modes involve almost perfectly horizontal displacement and thus, the radii of these compact pulsators hardly change.  Their brightness variations ($\\sim 0.1\\ {\\rm mag}$) are due to temperature variations on the stellar surface.\n",

    "Successful numerical calculations of pulsating white dwarf models were carried out by [Don Winget (and others)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ARA%26A..46..157W/abstract), where they demonstrated that the *hydrogen* partial ionization zone is responsible for driving oscillations in the ZZ Ceti stars.  These computations also confirmed the elemental stratification of white dwarf envelopes.  These numerical models predict that hotter DB white dwarfs should also exhibit *g*-mode oscillations driven by the *helium* partial ionization zone.  Within a year's time from the initial prediction, it was confirmed when the first **DBV** star was discovered.  Some stars are described by their transition to the white dwarf stage as: DOV and PNNVs stars that have an effective temperature $T_e \\approx 10^5\\ {\\rm K}$.  The DO spectral type marks the initial stage of the white dwarf and the PNNV stands for planetary nebula nuclei.\n",

A box of gas particles is filled with standing de Broglie waves that are described by three quantum numbers specifying a particle's momentum in each of three directions.  If the gas particles are fermions (e.g., electrons or neutrons), then the Pauli exclusion principle allows at most one fermion in each quantum state because no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers.\n",

Ordinary gas has a *thermal* pressure that is related to it temperature by the ideal gas law (i.e., $PV = NkT$).  As energy ($PV$) is removed from the gas and its temperature falls, an increasingly large fraction of the particles are forced into *lower* energy states.  If the particles are fermions, only one particle is allowed in each state and thus, all the particles cannot crowd into the ground state.\n",

    "Anthony Hewish and Jocelyn Bell were using an array of 2048 radio dipole antennae into a forest that covered 4.5 acres of the English countryside to study the scintillation (\"flickering\") at 81.5 MHz that is observed in radio waves from distant sources known as quasars.  In July 1969, Bell found a bit of \"scruff\" that reappeared every ~400 feet on the rolls of her strip chart recorder.  Careful measurements showed that the signal reappeared every 23 hours and 56 minutes, which indicates that the source passed over her *fixed* antennae array every sidereal day at the same time.  Bell concluded that the source was among the stars rather than within the Solar System.\n",

    "- Most pulsars have periods between $0.25-2\\ {\\rm s}$ with an average period of about $0.795\\ {\\rm s}$.  The pulsar with the longest known period is PSR 1841-0456 ($P = 11.8\\ {\\rm s}$).  The fastest known pulsar period is $1.39\\ {\\rm ms}$, which is measured for PSR J1748-2446ad, or Terzan 5ad.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The periods of all pulsars increase very gradually as the pulses slow down, where the rate of increase is given by the period derivative $\\dot{P} \\equiv dP/dt$.  Typicaly, $\\dot{P} \\approx 10^{-15}$ and the *characteristic lifetime* (i.e., the time it would take for the pulses to cease if $\\dot{P}$ were constant) is $P/\\dot{P} \\sim 10^7\\ {\\rm yr}$.  The change in period for PSR 1937+214 is unusually small, $\\dot{P} = 1.0151054 \\times 10^{-19}$, which corresponds to a characteristic lifetime of $1.48 \\times 10^{16}\\ {\\rm s}$ or about 470 Myr.\n",

    "### Possible Pulsar Models\n",
    "These characteristics enable astronomers to deduce the basic components of pulsars.  Hewish et al. (1968) suggested that an oscillating neutron star might be involved by [Gold (1968)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1968Natur.218..731G/abstract) quickly and convincingly argued instead that pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are three ways of obtaining rapid regular pulses in astronomy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary stars**.  If the orbital periods of a binary star system are to fall in the range of the observed pulsar periods, then extremely compact stars must be involved (e.g., white dwarfs or neutron stars).  \n",
    "    - If two Solar-mass stars were to orbit each other every 0.79 s, then their separation would be only $1.6 \\times 10^6\\ {\\rm m}$ from Newton's version of Kepler's third law.  This is much less than the $8.8 \\times 10^6\\ {\\rm m}$ radius of Sirius B, and the separation would be even smaller for more rapid pulsars.  This eliminates even the smallest, most massive white dwarfs from consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Neutron stars are so small that two of them could orbit each other with a period that agrees with the pulse period.  However, this possibility is ruled out by Einstein's general theory of relativity.  As the two neutron stars rapidly move through space-time, gravitational waves are generated that carry energy away from the binary system.  The neutron stars slowly spiral closer together (i.e., decreasing the orbital period) according to Kepler's third law, but there is an observed *increase* in the pulsar periods.  This eliminates binary neutron stars as a source of the radio pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pulsating stars**.\n",
    "    - White dwarfs oscillate with periods between $100-1000\\ {\\rm s}$.  The periods of the nonradial *g*-modes are much longer than the observed pulsar periods.  The period for the radial fundamental mode is a few seconds, which is too long to explain the faster pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Neutron stars are about $10^8\\times$ denser than white dwarfs and according to the period-mean density relationship for stellar pulsation, the period of oscillation is proportional to $\\rho^{-1/2}$.  This implies that neutron stars should vibrate approximately $10^4\\times$ more rapidly than white dwarfs.  The radial fundamental mode period would be around $10^{-4}\\ {\\rm s}$, where the nonradial *g*-modes would lie between $10^{-2}-10^{-1}\\ {\\rm s}$.  These periods are much too short for the slower pulsars, and this eliminates neutron star oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rotating stars**.  The enormous angular momentum of a rapidly rotating compact star would guarantee its precise clock-lik behavior.  To estimate how fast such objects must be spinning, we calculate its angular velocity $\\omega$ from the balance of gravity against the centripetal force.  This constraint is most severe at the star's equator, where the stellar material moves most rapidly, which causes an equatorial bulge.  Ignoring this effect, the maximum angular velocity can be found bye equating the centripetal and gravitational accelerations at the equator,\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ \\omega_{\\rm max}^2 R = \\frac{GM}{R^2}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    so that the minimum rotation period is $P_{\\rm min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega_{\\rm max}}$, or\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\n",
    "    P_{\\rm min} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{GM}}. \n",
    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "For a white dwarf like Sirius B, $P_{\\rm min} \\approx 7\\ {\\rm s}$, which is much too long.  However, for a $1.4\\ M_\\odot$ neutron star, $P_{\\rm min} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ {\\rm s}$.  Because this is a *minimum* rotation period, it can accommodate the complete range of periods observed for pulsars."

    "Only one alternative has emerged from the process of elimination that pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars.  This conclusion was strengthened by the discovery of pulsars associated with the Vela and Crab SNRs in 1968.

The Vela and Crab pulsars not only produce radio bursts, but alsop pulse in other regions of the EM spectrum ranging from radio to gamma rays.  Young pulsars also display **glitches** when their periods abruptly decrease by a tiny amount, $|\\Delta P|/P \\approx 10^{-6}-10^{-8}$, and these sudden spinups are separated by uneven intervals of several years.\n",

Both of these observations are consistent with a supernova origin for pulsars because a core-collapse supernova doesn't have to be perfectly spherically symmetric.

The radiation is strongly linearly polarized along the direction of the electron's motion.  Shklovsky predicted that the white light from the Crab Nebula would be strongly linearly polarized.  His prediction was confirmed as the light from some emitting regions of the nebula was measured as 60% linearly polarized.\n",

    "The explanation of the white glow as synchrotron radiation raised questions because it implied that magnetic fields must permeate the Crab Nebula.  According to theoretical estimates, this was a puzzle as the expansion of the nebula should have weakened the magnetic field far below $\\sim 10^{-7}\\ {\\rm T}$.  The electrons should have radiated away all of their energy after 100 years.

    "#### The Structure of the Pulses\n",
    "The pulses are brief and are received over a small fraction of the pulse period ($\\sim$ 1-5%).  Generally, they are received between 20 MHz and 10 GHz in the radio.  AS the pulses travel through interstellar space, they are modified by electrons that they encounter along the way through their time-varying electric fields.  This process slows the radio waves so that their speed is less than the speed of light in a vacuum and a greater retardation (i.e., slowing) occurs at lower frequencies.  The sharp pulse emitted at the neutron star (with all the frequencies peaking at the same time) is gradually dispersed as it travels to Earth.  More distant pulsars exhibit a greater pulse dispersion and these time delays can be used to measure the distances to pulsars.  From these distance measurements, we find that pulsars are concentrated within the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy at distances of 100-1000s of parsecs.\n",

Drifting subpulses may even emerge from a nulling event in step with those that entered the null.

To begin constructing the model, we need to obtain a measure of the pulsar's magnetic field strength.  As the pulsar rotates, the magnetic field at any point in space will change rapidly.  According to Faraday's law, this will induce an electric field at that point. \n",
