    "# The Fate of Massive Stars\n",

    "## Post-Main-Sequence Evolution of Massive Stars\n",
    "Since at least 1600, astronomers have observed [$\\eta$ Carinae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae), where its apparent magnitude was reported to be either 2 or 4.  In the early 1800s, it may have become significantly more active.  In 1837, $\\eta$ Car suddenly brightened, fluctuating in magnitude between $0-1$ and made it the second brightest object in the sky (only Sirius was brighter).  This brightening event is remarkable because the star is approximately 2300 pc from Earth, where Sirius is only 2.64 pc away.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 1856, $\\eta$ Car began to fade and dropped in magnitude to 8 by 1870.  Since 1895, $\\eta$ Car has been relatively quiet and it has brightened slightly to a magnitude 6 over the past ~150 years.  In a similar fashion, P Cygni was too faint to see with the naked eye before 1600, but suddenly brightened to a magnitude 3.  Following this event, P Cyg faded for a time and reappeared in 1655 becoming nearly as bright as it was in 1600.  Since 1700, P Cyg has been a magnitude 5 star, although it may have brighten slightly over the past several centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Luminous Blue Variables\n",
    "A small number of other stars in our own galaxy (some farther away) behave like $\\eta$ Car and P Cyg.  For example S Doradus (located in the Large Magellanic Cloud) is the best known extragalactic example.  Similar stars were discovered by Edwin Hubble and Allan Sandage, where this class of star are referred to as **S Doradus variables**, **Hubble-Sandage variables**, and **luminous blue variables** (LBVs).  \n",

    "$\\eta$ Carinae is a lumionous blue variable that is estimated to have a mas of $120\\ M_\\odot$ and is rapidly losing mass.  Each lobe has a diameter of approximately 0.1 pc. (Carroll & Ostlie (2007); Image Credit: Jon Morse (University of Colorado) & NASA Hubble Space Telescope)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An extreme example of an LBV is $\\eta$ Car, where it is known as the \"[homunculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Carinae#Homunculus)\" for its bipolar structure and equatorial disk.  From Doppler measurements, the lobes of $\\eta$ Car expand outward at $650\\ {\\rm km/s}$ and a range of velocities are recorded along any particular line-of-sight.  The expanding lobes are hollow, while the material in the shells contain molecules of ${\\rm H_2}$, ${\\rm CH}$, and ${\\rm OH}$.  It appears that the homunculus is significantly depleted in ${\\rm C}$ and ${\\rm O}$, while enriched in ${\\rm He}$ and ${\\rm N}$.  This suggests that the ejected material has been processed by the CNO cycle.  The present mass loss rate of $\\eta$ Car is $\\sim 10^{-3}\\ M_\\odot/{\\rm yr}$, but it has probably ejected $1-3\\ M_\\odot$ during the 20 years following the Great Eruption of 1837.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Great Eruption, $\\eta$ Car's luminosity could have been $4\\times$ brighter than its present quiescent luminosity ($\\sim 5\\times10^6\\ {\\rm L_\\odot}$).  The central star's effective temperature is roughly 30,000 K. As of 2007, the apparent magnitude in the visual was $m_V \\sim 6$, but now (2018) it has brightened to $m_V \\sim 4.3$.  Most of $\\eta$ Car's luminosity is initially emitted in the UV, which explains its high effective temperature.  Much of the UV is scattered, absorbed, and re-emitted by dust grains into the IR.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a class, LBV's tend to have high effective temperatures (15,000-30,000 K), with luminosities greater than $10^6\\ {\\rm L_\\odot}$.  As a result, LBVs are in the upper left-hand portion of the H-R diagram.  LBVs are clearly evolved, post-main-sequence stars given the composition of their atmospheres and ejecta.  LBVs also cluster in an instability region of the H-R diagram, which suggests that their behavior is transient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of mechanisms were proposed to explain the variability and dramatic mass loss of LBVs.  the upper end of the main sequence is very near the [Eddington luminosity limit](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_11/interiors-of-stars.html#the-eddington-luminosity-limit) where the force due to the radiation pressure may equal of exceed the gravitational force on the outer surface layers of a star.  The derived expression for the Eddington luminosity limit is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L_{{\\rm ED}} = \\frac{4\\pi Gc}{\\kappa}M, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which depends on the opacity $\\kappa$ and stellar mass $M$.  The \"classical\" Eddington limit assumes that the opacity is solely due to the scattering of free electrons, which is [constant](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_9/stellar-atmospheres.html#general-sources-of-opacity) $\\sigma_T$ for a completely ionized gas. A \"modified\" Eddington limit was proposed by [Humphreys & Davidson (1994)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994PASP..106.1025H/abstract), where some temperature-dependent factor of opacity modifies the overall opacity as the star evolves to the right in the H-R diagram.  As the temperature decreases and the *opacity increases*, the Eddington luminosity would drop below the actual luminosity of the star.  This implies that the radiation pressure dominates over gravity, which drives mass loss from the envelope.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second suggestion is that atmospheric pulsation instabilities may develop, like Cepheids, RR Lyrae, long-period variable stars.  Also intriguing is the apparent high rotation velocity of some LBVs.  Rapid rotation would result in decreasing the \"effective\" gravity at the equator due to centrifugal effects and allow for gases to be driven away from the surface at the equator.  The disk around $\\eta$ Car may have formed from a high spin during the lesser eruption between 1887-1895.\n",
    "\n",
    "LBVs could also be members of binary star systems as similar behaviors can be induced by the binary companion.  Interestingly, $\\eta$ Car exhibits a 5.54 yr periodicity in the equivalent widths (of some) of its spectral lines, which hints at the presence of a binary companion.  Although it is unclear how a binary companion can cause all of the effects observed.  It may turn out that more than one of the discussed mechanisms could influence the behavior of the LBVs or the principal mechanism has yet to be identified."

    "### Wolf-Rayet Stars\n",
    "Closely related to LBVs are the [Wolf-Rayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star) (WR) stars, which were first discovered by [Charles Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Wolf_(astronomer)) and [Georges Rayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Rayet) while working at the Paris Observatory in 1867.  Using a visual-wavelength spectrometer to conduct a survey of stars in Cygnus, they observed three stars (within one degree of each other) that exhibited strong, very broad emission lines rather than the typical absorption lines observed in other stars.  Today 220+ WR stars have been identified in the Milky Way, although the total number of WRs is estimated to be 1000-2000 on the basis of sampling statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with strong emission lines, WR stars are very hot, with effective temperatures of $25,000-100,000\\ {\\rm K}$.  WRs are also losing mass ($>10^{-5}\\ M_\\odot/{\\rm yr}$) with wind speeds from $800-3000\\ {\\rm km/s}$. There is strong evidence that many (perhaps all) WR stars are rapid rotators with equatorial speeds of $\\sim 300\\ {\\rm km/s}$.  LBVs are all very massive stars ($85\\ M_\\odot$), but WRs can have progenitor masses as low as $20\\ M_\\odot$.  Also, WRs do not demonstrate the dramatic variability that is characteristic of LBVs.\n",

    "As mentioned previously, the unusual spectra really sets WR stars apart from other stars.  The spectra also reveal a spectra that we today recognize as three classes: WN, WC, and WO.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WNs are dominated by emission lines of helium and nitrogen, although emission from carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen is detectable in some cases.\n",
    "- WCs exhibit emission lines of helium and carbon, with a distinct absence of nitrogen and hydrogen lines.\n",
    "- WOs are much rarer than either WNs or WCs.  They have spectra containing prominent oxygen lines, with some contribution from highly ionized species.\n",
    "\n",

    "- *WN2* stars show spectral lines of ${\\rm He\\ II}$, ${\\rm N\\ IV}$, and ${\\rm O\\ VI}$.\n",
    "- *WN9* stars contain spectra of low-ionization species, such as ${\\rm He\\ I}$ and ${\\rm N\\ III}$. \n",

    "- *WCL*s range from WC7-WC9\n",
    "\n",
    "A trend in composition from WN $\\rightarrow$ WC $\\rightarrow$ WO was eventually recognized as a direct consequence of the stellar mass loss.  WNs have lost virtually all of their hydrogen-dominated envelopes, which reveals the material synthesized by nuclear reactions in the core.  Core convection brings material to the surface that has been processed by the CNO cycle.  Additional mass loss results in the ejection of the CNO processed material, which exposes the helium-burning material generated by the triple alpha process.  If the star survives long enough, mass loss will eventually strip away all but the oxygen component of the triple-alpha ash.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to LBVs and WRs, the upper portion of the H-R diagram also contains **blue supergiants** (BSG), **red supergiants**, and **Of** stars (O supergiants with pronounced emission lines)."

    "Very massive stars are extremely rare (only one $100\\ M_\\odot$ star exists for every one million solar mass stars), but they play a major role in the dynamics and chemical evolution of the ISM.  The tremendous amount of kinetic energy deposited in the ISM through the stellar winds of massive stars has an impact on the kinematics of the ISM.  When very massive stars form, they have the ability to quench (stop) star formation in neighboring regions.  The UV light from massive stars can also ionize gas clouds around them.  The highly enriched gases of massive stellar winds increase the metal content of the ISM, resulting in the formation of increasingly metal-rich stars.\n",

    "The post-main-sequence evolution of stars more massive than about $8\\ M_\\odot$ is different.  Hydrogen is converted into helium on the main sequence and is followed by helium burning that leads to a carbon-oxygen core.  The very high temperature in the core of a massive star means that carbon and oxygen can burn as well.  The end result is that rather than the star ending its life through the formation of a planetary nebula, a catastrophic supernova explosion occurs instead.\n",

    "The details of supernovae are continually being worked out, but the story of how they are produced is becoming clearer.  The three types (Type Ib, Ic, and II) are closely related and involve the collapse of a massive, evolved stellar core.  Collectively, these supernovae are known as **core-collapse supernovae**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the helium-burning shell continues to add ash to the carbon-oxygen core (and as the core contracts), it eventually ignites in carbon burning and generates a variety of by-products (e.g., ${\\rm ^{16}_8 O}$, ${\\rm ^{23}_{11} Na}$, ${\\rm ^{23}_{12} Mg}$, and ${\\rm ^{24}_{12} Mg}$).  This leads to a succession of nuclear reaction sequences that depend sensitively on the stellar mass.\n",

    "Assuming that reach reaction sequence develops an equilibrium, an \"onion-like\" shell structure develops in the stellar interior.  Following carbon burning, the oxygen in the ${\\rm Ne-O}$ core will ignite, which produces a new core composition dominated by silicon-28.

    "The most carefully studied supernova to date has been SN 1987A.  As soon as it was discovered, astronomers realized that SN 1987A was unusual when compared with more distant Type II supernovae observations.  It had a rather slow rise to the maximum light (taking 80 days), which peaked only at an absolute bolometric magnitude of $-15.5$, whereas a typical Type II peaks at $M_{\\rm bol} = -18$.\n",

    "Nickel-56 was produced by the shock and it totals $0.075\\ M_\\odot$ of material.  The timescale for the decay energy to be radiated away is quite long and the decay energy produces a bump on the light curve near the maximum rather than forming a plateau.  By the time the resulting cobalt-56 begins to decay, the decrease in luminosity of the remnant tracks closely with the cobalt-56.  The next important radioactive isotope, cobalt-57, plays an important role in the development of the light curve of SN 1987A.\n",
    "\n",
    "SN 1987A allowed astronomers to directly measure the X-ray and gamma-ray emission lines produced by radioactive decay for the first time.  In particular, the 847 keV and 1238 keV lines of cobalt-56 were detected by a number of experiments, which confirmed the presence of the isotope. "

    "The mystery of the subluminous nature of SN 1987a was solved after identifying its progenitor star, which was a spectral class B3 I *blue* supergiant, [Sk -69 202](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanduleak_-69_202).  Since the progenitor was a BSG instead of a RSG (as is usually assumed), the star was more dense.  Before the thermal energy produced by the shock could diffuse out and escape, it was converted into the mechanical energy required to lift the envelope of the star out of the deeper potential well of the blue supergiant.  Measurements of ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ lines indicate that some of the outer hydrogen envelope was ejected at speeds of nearly $30,000\\ {\\rm km/s}$, or $0.1c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available observations of Sk -69 202 tied with the theoretical evolutionary models suggest that the progenitor of SN 1987A had a mass of roughly $20\\ M_\\odot$ when it was on the main sequence and it lost a few solar masses ($\\sim 1.4-1.6\\ M_\\odot$) before its iron core collapsed.  Although it was apparently a RSG for $\\sim 10^5-10^6\\ {\\rm yr}$, where it evolved to the BSG just 40,000 years before the explosion.  Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that hydrogen was more abundant in the stellar envelope than helium, which suggests that the star had not suffered an extensive amount of mass loss.  \n",

    "### Supernova Remnants\n",
    "There are now many examples of **supernova remnants** (SNR), such as the Crab Nebula that is located in Taurus.  Nearly 1000 years since the SN 154 explosion, the Crab is still expanding a $\\sim 1450\\ {\\rm km/s}$ and it has a luminosity of 80,000 $L_\\odot$.  Much of the emitted radiation is in the form of highly polarized synchrotron radiation, which indicates the presence of relativistic electrons that are spiraling around magnetic field lines.  The ongoing source of the electrons and the continued high luminosity so long after the explosion were major puzzles until the discovery of a **pulsar** (i.e., a rapidly spinning neutron star) at the center of the Crab SNR.  The Cygnus Loop nebula is another example of a SNR, where it is located 800 pc away and is 15,000 years old.  The remnant shows shock fronts several AU wide as the debris from the supernova explosion encounters material in the ISM.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The two larger rings lie in front of and behind the star (i.e., not in planes containing the central explosion).  One explanation is that SK -69 202 had a nearby companion object (possibly a neutron star or black hole).  As the companion source wobbles, narrow jets of radiation from the source would \"paint\" the rings in an hourglass-shaped bipolar distribution.  In support of this hypothesis, researcher may have identified the source of these beams, which is about 0.1 pc from the center of the supernova explosion.  Opponents of this model suggest that the explanation is too complicated, where it requires two sources of high-energy radiation: one to explain the central ring and another to explain larger ones.  Alternatively the larger rings could be the product of a hot, fast stellar wind from the BSG progenitor overtaking the slower, cooler wind given off  by the star when it was a RSG.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the summer of 1990, fluctuating radio emission was detected from the supernova.  Apparently the shock wave collided with clumps of material lost from SK -69 202 prior to the supernova explostion.  The shock front from the expanding supernova remnant began to collide with the slower-moving stellar wind comprising the inner ring in 1996.  Bright clumps in the inner ring developed over the next several years.\n",

    "One of the most exciting early observations of SN 1987A waw based on its nuetrinos, which represented the first time the neutrinos were detected from an astronomical source *other than the Sun.*  The measurement confirmed the basic theory of core-collapse supernovae and provided near direct evidence for the formation of a neutron star out of the collapsed iron core.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrival of the neutrino burst wes recored over a duration of 12.5 seconds that was three hours *before* the arrival of the photons.  Twelve events were recorded at Japan's Kamiokande II Cerenkov detector and contemporaneously, eight events were detected by the IMB Cenrenkov detector near Fairport, OH.  The neutrions began their trip ahead of the photons assuming the the exploding star became optically thin to neutrions before the shock wave reached the surface and the neutrionos traveled faster than the shock while still inside the star.  Also the neutrinos must have been very near the speed of light to not be overtaken by the photons.  There was not a significant dispersion in the neutrino energy, which suggests that the rest mass of the electron neutrions must be quite small.  Based on data from SN 1987A, the electron neutrino mass was less than 16 eV, which is consistent with lab experiments that place the upper limit at 2.2 eV.\n",

    "[Page et al. (2020)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab93c2) report a suspected detection of a compact in the remnant of SN 1987A.  The purported detection comes from an IR excess due to the decay ${\\rm ^{44}Ti}$, accretion luminosity from a neutron star or black hole, magnetospheric emission or a wind originating from the spin down of a pulsar, or to thermal emission from an embedded, cooling neutron star.  The upper limit on the luminosity in the visible is less than $8\\times 10^{26}\\ {\\rm W}$, which is equivalent to the optical energy output of an F6 main-sequence star.  UV spectra lead to an upper limit of $L_{\\rm UV} \\leq 1.7 \\times 10^{27}\\ {\\rm W}$, and Chandra has set an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of $L_{\\rm X} \\leq 5.5 \\times 10^{26}\\ {\\rm W}$ between 2-10 keV."

    "### Chemical Abundance Ratios in the Universe\n",
    "A critical component in the evaluating the success of stellar evolution theory is the ability ot explain the observed elemental abundance ratios.  The abundant element in the universe is hydrogen, followed by helium (reduced by a factor of 10).  Current cosmological models produce all the hydrogen in the Big Bang that started the universe, which makes hydrogen primordial.  Much of the present-day helium was also produced in the Big Bang, while the remainder of the elements are produced from fusion processes in stellar interiors.\n",

Combining stellar structure theory, the mixing-length theory of convection, and an analysis of solar oscillations, indicates that the base of the convection zone extends dow to only $2.3 \\times 10^6\\ {\\rm K}$, which is not far enough to burn lithium adequately.  Perhaps the momenta of the descending convective bubbles *overshoot* the bottom of the convective zone, causing lithium to be transported deeper than the standard models suggest.
